# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Porpuse: Launch of a New Crowdfunding Campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* data is Skewed and I wasnt able to figure out how to better normlize it, but using the median instead of the mean for some of the data solved the problem
* The standard deviations are larger than the mean.
* There is a correlation between Failed Campaigns and High Goals that needs more analysis towards reduce the number of ampaigns missing their goals.

## Results

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* Most Successful Month = MAY
* Least Successful Month = OCT

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns
* The mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money.
